COMP 249
  The course covers the higher-level subjects of object-oriented programming, including the design of classes, inheritance, composition, polymorphism, static and dynamic binding, abstract classes, exception handling, file I/O, recursion, interfaces, inner classes, graphical user interfaces, generics, collections and iterators. Various data structures will be introduced including Array Lists, Linked Lists, Hash Tables, Tress and Sets.
  By the end of this course you will be able to:
  1. Write more modular, robust and flexible Java programs by building on the knowledge you acquired in COMP 248 (Object           oriented Programming I).
  2. Design and implement Java programs which:
    - Include a hierarchy of classes (inheritance , polymorphism and abstract classes, inner
      classes and interfaces)
    - Include generic classes
    - Deal with unexpected situations (exception handling)
    - Read and/or write data to/from a file (not just from a keyboard and to the screen)
    - Use Collections and make use of tools that allow you cycle through all elements of a collection (iterators)
    - Use data structure classes which are available in Java libraries such as Array Lists, Linked Lists, Hash Tables, Trees  and Sets to name a few.
  3. Design and implement:
    - Methods that call themselves (recursion)
    - Graphical user interfaces (GUIs)
