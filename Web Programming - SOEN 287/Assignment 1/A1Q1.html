        <dt>Provinces</dt>
        <dd>
          Provinces receive their power and authority from the Constitution Act, 1867 (formerly called the British North America Act, 1867).
          The powers flowing from the Constitution Act are divided between the Government of Canada (the federal government) and the
          provincial governments to exercise exclusively. A change to the division of powers between the federal government and the provinces
          requires a constitutional amendment.

      <dd>
        Territorial governments have powers delegated to them by the Parliament of Canada. Changes affecting the territories can be performed
        unilaterally by the parliement of Canada or government.
